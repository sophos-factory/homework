# Homework Coding Challenges

As part of the Sophos Factory interview process, we use a homework assignment to assess your programming ability. Please spend no more than the allotted time on one task.

Unless we’ve requested a specific challenge, please choose the most relevant task out of the options in this repository for the position you're interested in. Your choice of task is also part of the assessment!

## Submission Instructions

When complete, upload your assignment to a private GitHub repository and add the following users to the repository:

- [sophosanthony](https://github.com/sophosanthony)
- [sophos-daniels](https://github.com/sophos-daniels)
- [sophos-victoria](https://github.com/sophos-victoria)

When we assess your work, we'll look at all aspects of your code quality and GitHub repository – commit history, code readability and documentation, any use of GitHub features, etc.

We'll review your homework within two business days of being added to your repo and then let you know how we'd like to proceed. Regardless of whether we decide to continue, we'll offer constructive feedback on your submission.

Thank you again for your interest in pursuing a position at Sophos Factory! Good luck!
